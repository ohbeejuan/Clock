# This is a simple program that I wrote that displays both a 12 hour and a 24 hour clock. There is not a ton to reflect on here it is a pretty straight forward code. I took a lot of care to get the spacing layout correct and was having problems with whitespaces before and after the times displayed. It would be inconsistent if the hour was one or two digits. I fixed that problem, by more precisingly defining how the output table worked.
